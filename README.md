# Car-Price-Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting car prices based on various features. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of a car given its specifications.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of information about various cars, including features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, engine size, and more. It is sourced from kaggle.

Project Structure

data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
models: Saved trained machine learning models.
utils: Utility functions and scripts used in the project.
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.
Usage

To run this project, make sure you have Python installed along with the dependencies listed in requirements.txt. You can install the dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

After installing the dependencies, open the Jupyter notebook file `car_price_prediction.ipynb` located in the `notebooks` directory. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute each cell sequentially. This notebook contains the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

Ensure you have the dataset available in the `data` directory or provide the path to your dataset in the notebook.

Finally, execute the cells to train the model and make predictions on new car data.

This Markdown provides instructions specifically tailored for your single Jupyter notebook file. Feel free to adjust it according to your project's specific requirements!
